The file /plinko-web/plinko-web/assets/sounds/score.mp3 should contain the audio file for the score sound effect. Since I cannot generate binary audio files directly, you will need to create or obtain an appropriate MP3 file and place it in the specified directory.

Please ensure that the score.mp3 file is added to the /plinko-web/plinko-web/assets/sounds/ directory manually.
